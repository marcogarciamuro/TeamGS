                            Team GS, short for Team Gumshoe, is a website
                            that provides a central space where you can:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Follow the teams that you support</li>
                                <li>View a team's scheduled/previous games</li>
                                <li>Check a team's rank in their respective league or conference</li>
                                <li>Read what the world of sports is saying about a team in news articles</li>
                                <li>Talk to fellow fans about a team</li>
                            </ul>

                            The data and information that this website displays
                            was retreived using the APIs: API-Football, API-NBA, and
                            NewsAPI.

                            The drive for creating this website was my strong passion
                            for sports.
                            I am a huge fan of soccer and basketball and I wanted to create
                            a service that would inform similar fans about these
                            sports and the teams they like.
                            More specifcally, the creation of this site
                            came about because of previous inconveniences and
                            annoyances.
                            I was constantly Googling when a certain
                            team played, and when this other certain team played,
                            or if there were any live games I could watch at that
                            current time. This sparked an idea to create a space
                            where people could see easily track and view information
                            about the teams/sports they regularly watch or support.
